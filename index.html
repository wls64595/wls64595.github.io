		<p class="groove"> With the Kentucky game approaching, the Georgia Bulldogs conducted a two-hour practice Wednesday in full pads at the Club Sports Complex on Milledge Avenue. Georgia's Kirby Smart participated in the SEC Coaches weekly media teleconference earlier in the day and said the Bulldogs are gearing up for Saturday's road game against a red-hot Wildcat squad.
	"It should be an exciting atmosphere with the streak they're on and playing really good football" said Smart. "They are running the ball well, have an improved defense and special teams."  </p>
		<p class="dotted"> Smart fielded a question about the play of the Bulldog offensive line and said they have not been as consistent as he would like, however that goes for the entire team.

"Some games we've played well and others we didn't and lot has to do with who you're going up against," said Smart. "Teams defend us differently. Our goal all the time is to get better, each week to show improvement."

For example, Smart said he thought Georgia improved in some areas on special teams during the off week but not in others.

"We've been very inconsistent, but the kids have been resilient," said Smart. "They are in good spirits. We've had lively practices, and they are giving us all they got, and that's what we've asked of them."

The Bulldogs (4-4, 2-4 SEC) and Kentucky square off Saturday with kickoff slated for 7:30 p.m. on the SEC Network. </p>
